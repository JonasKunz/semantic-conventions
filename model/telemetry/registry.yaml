    brief: >
        This document defines attributes for telemetry SDK.
    attributes:
      - id: telemetry.sdk.name
        type: string
        stability: stable
        brief: >
          The name of the telemetry SDK as defined above.
        note: |
          The OpenTelemetry SDK MUST set the `telemetry.sdk.name` attribute to `opentelemetry`.
          If another SDK, like a fork or a vendor-provided implementation, is used, this SDK MUST set the
          `telemetry.sdk.name` attribute to the fully-qualified class or module name of this SDK's main entry point
          or another suitable identifier depending on the language.
          The identifier `opentelemetry` is reserved and MUST NOT be used in this case.
          All custom identifiers SHOULD be stable across different versions of an implementation.

          The version string of the telemetry SDK.

        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The name of the auto instrumentation agent or distribution, if used.
        note: |
          Official auto instrumentation agents and distributions SHOULD set the `telemetry.distro.name` attribute to
          a string starting with `opentelemetry-`, e.g. `opentelemetry-java-instrumentation`.
        examples: ["parts-unlimited-java"]

      - id: telemetry.sdk.processor.type
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          A name identifying the type of the OpenTelemetry SDK processor.
        note: |
          The value `batch-span` MUST be used for the SDK builtin Batch Span Processor.
        examples: ["batch-span", "MyCustomProcessor"]
      - id: telemetry.sdk.exporter.type
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          A name identifying the type of the OpenTelemetry SDK exporter.
        note: |
          For OTLP, the values `otlp-grpc`, `otlp-http` or `otlp-http-json` MUST be used, based on the transport and serialization format.
        examples: ["otlp-grpc", "jaeger"]
      - id: telemetry.sdk.component.id
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          A name uniquely identifying the instance of the OpenTelemetry SDK component within its containing SDK instance.
        note: |
          The SDK MAY allow users to provide an id for the component instances. If no id is provided by the user,
          the SDK SHOULD automatically assign an id. Because this attribute is used in metrics, the SDK MUST ensure a low cardinality in that case.
          E.g. it MUST NOT use a UUID.
          It instead MAY do that by using the following pattern as value: `<telemetry.sdk.processor/exporter.type>-<instance-counter>`:
          Hereby, `<instance-counter>` is a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
          instance of the given component type is created.
          For example, the first Batch Span Processor will have `batch-span-0` as `telemetry.sdk.component.id`, the second one `batch-span-1` and so one.
          These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.
        examples: ["batch-span-0", "custom-name"]
