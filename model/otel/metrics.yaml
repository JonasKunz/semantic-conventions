      For the SDK Simple and Batching Span Processor a span is considered to be processed already when it has been submitted to the exporter, not when the corresponding export call has finished.

          A low-cardinality description of the failure reason. SDK Batching Span Processors MUST use `queue_full` for spans dropped due to a full queue.
