    brief: "The number of spans submitted for processing to this span processor."
    note: |
      A span is considered submitted when the first callback has been called which triggers processing of the span for the given processor.
      For the Batching and Simple Span Processors this metric therefore MUST be incremented on invocations of the `on_end` span processor callback.

          A low-cardinality description of the failure reason. SDK Batching Span Processors MUST use `queue full` for spans dropped due to a full queue.
